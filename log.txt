Welcome to the DDS v2 software, part of LDCS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This software creates a local copy of the LDCS Rucio database, perform some post processing and generate list of files at different RSEs.
Another software, called the dumper, running on the RSE generates a dump of files at directories registered in Rucio for that RSE.
This software compares the two lists and generates a list of files that are missing from Rucio or missing from storage.
For files missing from storage, it finds all the replicas of that file at other locations, in case we want to recover the file.
For files missing from Rucio it shecks if the file is a duplciate file
These files are then verified to be lost by checking Rucio and the RSE again.
The list of files that are lost are then sent to the LDCS team or deleted automaticaly.
